    <string name="help_text">The basic mnemonic and Dominican systems are not widespread in the Russian-speaking environment. The purpose of this application is to allow a Russian—speaking user to use both mnemonic systems using a smartphone.\n
        A new mnemonic system is a method of memorizing information using associations and images that are easy to remember. This system is based on the use of images, sounds and other sensory inputs to create connections between new information and existing knowledge. It can be used to memorize any kind of information, including numbers, words, facts, and more. The basic mnemonic system is one of the most effective ways of memorizing information and can be used by anyone at any age.\n
        The seed system (also called phonetic number system, phonetic mnemonic system, or Herigon mnemonic system) is a mnemonic technique used to aid in memorizing numbers. The system works by converting numbers into consonants and then into words by adding vowels. The system works according to the principle that images are easier to remember than numbers.\n
        The main difference between the Dominic system and the major system is the assignment of sounds and letters to numbers. The Dominique system is a letter-based abbreviation system where the letters make up the initials of someone\'s name, while the basic system is usually used as a phonetic consonant system to refer to objects, animals, people, or even words.
